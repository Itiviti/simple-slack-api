# Simple Slack API

This library allows an application to connect to [Slack](http://www.slack.com/) to receive and send messages from any channel as if it were a slack client.

The main purpose of this library is to build Slack bots able to react to channel events without having to configure any web hook.

With this library you should be able to connect to Slack and to send some messages in less than 20 lines (no one-liners).

## Maven/Gradle

You can add this library as a dependency to your Maven or Gradle project through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#Ullink/simple-slack-api).

Released versions are also availables on the maven central repository :

* *group id:* com.ullink.slack
* *artifact id:* simpleslackapi

## How to use it ?

You can find some samples of the most common use cases in the [samples](https://github.com/Ullink/simple-slack-api/tree/master/samples) folder.

Sample code

```java
SlackSession session = SlackSessionFactory.createWebSocketSlackSession("slack-bot-auth-token");
session.connect();
SlackChannel channel = session.findChannelByName("general"); //make sure bot is a member of the channel.
session.sendMessage(channel, "hi im a bot" );
```

## Features

### Supported Slack commands

All these commands can be sent through the library provided your bot has the rights to (IE : the bot has to be a member of the group or the channel to post some messages on it)

* Post a message on a channel / private group / user
* Post a typing indicator on a channel
* Update a message
* Delete a message
* Join a channel
* Leave a channel / a private group
* Invite to a channel / a private group
* Archive a channel
* Open a direct message channel (since v0.5.0)

* Get the presence status of a user

On top of these built-in features, it is now possible to send not yet implemented API calls by using the postGenericSlackCommand method : 

```java
postGenericSlackCommand(Map<String, String> params, String command);
```
